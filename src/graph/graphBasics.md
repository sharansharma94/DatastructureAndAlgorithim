### Example

> const V = { 0, 1, 2, 3};
   const E = { [0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2]};
   const G = { V, E } 


### Adjacency 
> if edge is directly connecting them 

### Path 
> sequence of edges that allows you to go from vertex A to B.

### Directed Graph 
> edge(u,v) does not always mean edge (v,u)


## Representation 

1. Adjacency matrix
    >  
    a. V*V matrix
    b. edge lookup is fast
    c. Requires more space

2. Adjacency list
>
    a. array of linked list 
    b. requires less storage

## operations

1. check if element is present in the graph 
2. Graph Traversal 
3. Add elements(vertex, edges) to graph 
4. Find path from one vertex to another.

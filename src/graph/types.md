### Undirected Graph
A graph where edges don't point at any directions

### Connected Graph
Always a path from a vertex to any other vertex

### Spanning tree
A sub-graph of an undirected and connected graph which includes all the vertices of the graph with a minimum possible number of edges. if a vertex is missed it's not a spanning tree

edges may or maynot have weights

> total number of spanning tree with n vertices that can be created from a complete graph is equal to n ^(n-2)
> Example : n =4 
> 4^4-2 = 16 
> Thus 16 spanning trees can be formed from a complete graph with 4 vertices.


### Minimum Spanning tree 
Is a spanning tree in which the sum of weight of the edges is as minimum as possible


### Algos to find minimum spanning tree
1. Prim's Algo
2. Kruskal's Algo

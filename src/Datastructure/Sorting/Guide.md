### Sorting

1. Bubble sort

   Terrible complexity Big O(n^2) except when n <= 16

2. Insertion sort

   **Pros** Sorting can be done while adding elements continuously

   Similar to Deck of cards , start with empty left hand and pick up one at a time and put it on the right place by comparing from right to left in left hand.
